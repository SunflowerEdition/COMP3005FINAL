Program file are located under the "Program" directory and the SQL files are located under the "SQL" directory.

The program was written in JAVA and is a command-line interface program. The program was designed to use
PostgreSQL. If you wish to run it yourself, create a new database and first upload the DDL.sql file followed
by the DML.sql file. Next, in the program files, search for "Database.java". You will have to modify the
"URL", "USER", and "PASSWORD" variables for it to successfully connect to the database on your device.

Please note that this program was written and run using IntelliJ. For best result, import the program into 
a new project and run it using IntelliJ.
